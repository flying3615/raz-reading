When it reaches the surface, it cools and becomes solid rock. The rock builds up over time. The rock may form a mountain or even an island. This is how Hawaii's islands formed.

Where does this energy come from? y Energy comes from many kinds of important natural resources. Sunlight is our most important natural resource. Coal, natural gas, and oil are natural resources, too. So are things like plants, 4 : HR Pa wind, and water.

A TY 15% FERC | | CCE A ba Old Faithful is not the largest geyser in Yellowstone, but it is the one most people go to see. A Hot Spot Many people who go to Yellowstone want to see Old Faithful geyser. A geyser is a hole in the ground that shoots steam and hot water into the air. Yellowstone has about three hundred of them. Old Faithful shoots water 100 feet (30 m) high about every ninety minutes. Yellowstone Supervolcano Yellowstone is home to an old caved-in volcano. Over the past two million years, the volcano has had three big eruptions. The rim of the caved-in volcano is huge. It is more than 45 miles (72 km) across in some places. People still watch Yellowstone closely. The volcano doesn't look as if it is going to erupt again soon. Yellowstone: A Place of Wild Wonders e Level K 2)"
