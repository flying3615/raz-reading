He couldn't find a way to get inside the fort. So he tied himself to a huge kite. He flew over the wall of the fort and scared the soldiers!

Energy from the Sun changed the liquid to a gas in a process called evaporation. Water evaporates from oceans, rivers, lakes, and puddles all over the world. Es bes When water vapor in the air cools down, it changes from a gas to a liquid. This process is called condensation. Clouds are made up of tiny drops of water formed by condensation.

A Volcano Wonderland Every day on the island of Hawaii, lava seeps from a volcano on the edge of the ocean. When the lava cools, it turns into rock and makes the island a little bigger. This volcano is part of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Every year, over one million people visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. National parks are areas of protected land. Volcanoes Form a Park A volcano begins when melted rock from deep inside Earth comes out through a crack in Earth's surface. When it reaches the surface, it cools and becomes solid rock. The rock builds up over time. The rock may form a mountain or even an island. This is how Hawaii's islands formed. Two of the world’s most amazing volcanoes are found in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

Bright balloons fly slowly and silently through the air. Dan Saul has been flying hot-air balloons since 1979. The Balloon Interviewer: How does a hot-air balloon fly? Dan: A balloon flies because it’s full of hot air. Hot air rises when the air around it is cooler. The pilot blows up the balloon with a strong fan. Then a large burner heats the air inside the balloon. Blowing Up a Hot-air Balloon parachute © Crew members carefully A 8 spread the envelope and check j to make sure nothing is twisted.

There are smaller balloons built for one person. And there are big ones for up to twenty-two people. Interviewer: What's the balloon made of? Dan: It’s made of strong nylon that doesn’t tear easily. Interviewer: What do you carry in the basket? Dan: We carry fuel tanks, tools, and people. The tools tell us how high the balloon is and the temperature of the air.

People started carving jack-o-lanterns more than a hundred years ago. At first, people didn’t carve pumpkins. They used other vegetables instead. An old fable from Ireland may tell how people began carving jack-o™-lanterns. The fable is about a man named Stingy Jack, who liked to play tricks on everyone. When he died, he was cursed to walk in darkness forever. He carved a turnip and put a light inside. His ghost was known as “Tack of the Lantern,” and then “Jack-o’-lantern.” Jer a 7%) oa ey 5 ng AL SY 7 XA sAWTE 48 RIT + Z qos 0. 2 Say WF Sd N NNER 2 VP NNT ARP A 777 Jack-o'-Lanterns Level K 5 Modern Jack-o-Lanterns The Stingy Jack fable later became part of a night called All Hallows’ Eve.

He would also have to face prejudice because he was African American. Jackie Robinson « Level K 9 Rickey hired Robinson. He had one condition, though.

He was in second grade, but he told himself he was only two years old. Today was his birthday: February 29, otherwise known as leap day. That day only came once every four years, though. As far as Leroy was concerned, that meant he only had a real birthday once every four years.

You need an extra quarter of a turn, or six hours, every year. In four years, that adds up to one full extra day, a special year with 366 days.” “Calendars would not work without leap years,” she added. “In a hundred years, summer would start almost a month later.” “Why are they called leap years?” Leroy asked. The librarian smiled. “Say New Year’s Eve was Sunday last year. Usually that means it would be Monday this year, but in a leap year, it would be Tuesday.

History For hundreds of years, Korea was a hard place to get to. Its people were mostly left alone. Different kingdoms took control of the land. Japan took control of Korea in 1905. It remained under Japan's control until the end of World War IL When the war ended, most world leaders wanted Korea to have its own government. The United States and a country called the Soviet Union were supposed to help. They did not agree. In the end, South Korea freely chose its leaders. North Korea set up a government that was less free.

Then the tarantula sucks up a tasty meal. Do You Know? Tarantula fangs can measure up to one-half inch (more than 1 cm) long.

The wasp lays one egg on the tarantula’s body. When the young insect comes out, it feeds on the tarantula. Tarantula! e Level K 13 How Safe Are Tarantulas?

A canyon is a big, steep valley that is usually formed by a river. The Grand Canyon National Park covers about 1,900 square miles (4921 sq km). In some places the canyon is more than a mile (1.6 km) deep. It can take two weeks to go through the canyon on a river raft. pe CE I Date S08 gr ite + barces 31% a IV o-oo UEETH Wig a AN ie i He 4. - us PS SRV (72! h > a 7 i: x a sep! of ¥ i { i a B/C : LE SEN PA 4’ 2 / E ; i A I AX Rice 7 BR By ANSON re Zz 3 - u 2 - BB > H = Om, —— Ee - A RR EE 7 Diem ad od ma LL “Ve” i le ro HD yd SET FU or) The canyon walls are made from rocks that are millions of years old.

The Colorado River wears away soil, rock, and other materials, making the Grand Canyon deeper every day. The Grand Canyon © Level K 7 The Grand Canyon is striped with colors.

Energy lights, heats, and cools our homes and schools. It allows things to move around. You need energy to run and play. You need energy to think and sleep. Where does this energy come from? Energy comes from many kinds of important natural resources. Sunlight is our most important natural resource. Coal, natural gas, and oil are natural resources, too.

Animals you eat may get energy from the plants they eat. Plants use energy from the Sun to make their own food. Plants can store the food they make in roots, stems, and leaves. Energy from Gasoline Most cars, trucks, planes, and trains get energy from gasoline. Gasoline is made from oil. Oil is a natural resource found deep underground. Wells pump oil up from the ground.

Yellowstone has about three hundred of them. Old Faithful shoots water 100 feet (30 m) high about every ninety minutes. Yellowstone Supervolcano Yellowstone is home to an old caved-in volcano. Over the past two million years, the volcano has had three big eruptions. The rim of the caved-in volcano is huge. It is more than 45 miles (72 km) across in some places.
